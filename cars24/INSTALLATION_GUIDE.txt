// Installation Guide for Notification System Dependencies

// Run these commands to install required packages:

// 1. Firebase packages (required)
npm install firebase firebase-admin

// 2. Lucide React icons (already installed, but included for reference)
npm install lucide-react

// 3. Radix UI components (already installed, but included for reference)
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu

// After installation, you need to:

// 1. Create a .env.local file with Firebase credentials
//    (Copy from .env.example and fill in your Firebase project details)

// 2. Build the service worker
//    The file at public/firebase-messaging-sw.ts needs to be compiled
//    It will be served as public/firebase-messaging-sw.js at runtime

// 3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled
//    Service Workers and Push Notifications require HTTPS in production
//    In development, localhost:3000 is allowed

// 4. Test notification permissions
//    Open DevTools > Application > Manifest to verify service worker registration
//    Check that notification permission is requested on page load

// Verify Installation
// After setup, check:
// - Service worker is registered (DevTools > Application > Service Workers)
// - FCM token is generated (check browser console)
// - Notification permission prompt appears
